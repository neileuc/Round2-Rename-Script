## Purpose:
This script has been made in order to rename files within a directory with like named files, with a new name and with correct number sequencing.
## Reasoning:
The reason why I have chosen powershell as the script language is due to the fact its POSIX complaint  (with some minor preinstallations on macOS and Linux) and due to it being easier for someone who isn't confident in scripting in breaking down what is happening - should there need to be future adjustments and extentions.

## Features
- User defined Directory path to rename
- Only like filetype's renamed
- Friendly script for further editing
